			<br>
			<br>
			<p class= "content3"> Every booking comes with AirCover for guests. If there’s a serious issue with your Airbnb<br>that your Host can’t
			resolve, we’ll help you find a similar place, depending on availability at<br>comparable pricing. If a similar place
			isn’t available or you’d prefer not to rebook, we’ll give<br>you a full or partial refund.</p>
			<br>
			<p class= "content3">If anything comes up, your Host is your best point of contact; it’s likely they’ll be able to fix<br>
			it. <u>You can message your Host</u> directly to let them know what’s going on.</p>

			<h2>Host cancellation</h2>
			<p class= "content3">If your Host cancels within 30 days of check-in, we’ll help you find a similar place,
			depending<br>on availability at comparable pricing. If a similar place isn’t available or you’d prefer not to<br>
			rebook, we’ll give you a refund.</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Unable to check in</h2>
			<p class= "content3">When you have a confirmed reservation, you’ll have your Host’s email and phone number in<br> the message thread for your trip.
			If you can’t get into your Airbnb on arrival and your Host <br>doesn’t respond or can’t resolve the issue, we’ll help you find a similar
			place, depending on<br> availability at comparable pricing. If a similar place isn’t available or you’d prefer not to <br>rebook,
			we’ll give you a refund. </p>
			<p>Check out what to do next <a><b><u>if you can’t get in touch with your Host.</u></a></b></p>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<h2>Inaccurate listings</h2>
			<p class= "content3">If the listing is significantly different than advertised, your Host is a great resource to fix the <br>issue. If the listing is
			significantly different than advertised and your Host can’t resolve the <br>issue, we’ll help you find a similar place, depending on
			availability at comparable pricing. If a <br>similar place isn’t available or you’d prefer not to rebook, we’ll give you a full
			or partial refund.</p>

			<h2>How AirCover for guests works</h2>
			<p class= "content3">AirCover for guests provides support for serious issues with your booking (e.g. Host <br>cancellation within 30 days of
			check-in) or during your stay (e.g. The heating is not working <br>in winter, the listing has fewer bedrooms than listed,
			it’s a different type of home – a private<br> room instead of an entire home, a major advertised amenity such as a pool or
			kitchen is<br> missing), but it doesn’t include more minor inconveniences, like a broken toaster.</p>
			<p class= "content3">Your Host is the best person to contact if anything comes up. <a><u>You can message your Host</a></u> <br>directly to let them know what’s
			going on.</p>
			<p class= "content3">If an issue does come up during your stay:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Take photos or videos of the issue, if you can.</li>
			<li>Contact your Host within 72 hours of discovering the problem and describe the issue to them to see if they can resolve it.</li>
			<li> you’re a Host, learn more about AirCover for Hosts and recent improvements we’ve made.If your Host can’t resolve the issue or doesn’t respond at all, contact us as soon as possible.</li>
			<li>We’ll review it and if we find it’s an issue that’s supported by AirCover for guests and you’d like to leave the
			place, we’ll help you find a similar place to stay, depending on availability at comparable pricing. If a similar
			place isn’t available or you’d prefer not to rebook, we’ll give you a full or partial refund.</li>
			</ul>
